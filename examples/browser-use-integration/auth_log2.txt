INFO     [Agent] [34m🎯 Task: Go to https://profilio-z561-het-s-projects-30bce613.vercel.app/ai-auth/login and click on the 'Sign in with Auth Agent' button. When the spinning authentication page appears (shows 'Authenticating AI Agent' with a spinner), use the authenticate_with_auth_agent tool to complete the authentication. Wait for the page to redirect after authentication succeeds. Keep waiting until you reach the dashboard page - do not stop until you see the dashboard. The dashboard should show profile information or user/agent data. Only use the 'done' tool when you have successfully reached and verified you are on the dashboard page.[0m

INFO     [Agent]   🧠 Memory: The goal is to authenticate the AI agent by clicking the 'Sign in with Auth Agent' button, waiting for the spinning authentication page, and then using the `authenticate_with_auth_agent` tool. Finally, I need to wait for the redirect to the dashboard page and use the `done` tool. The current page has the required button.

INFO     [Agent] 📍 Step 2:
INFO     [Agent]   🧠 Memory: The previous step successfully clicked the 'Sign in with Auth Agent' button, which led to the spinning authentication page. The current page is the 'Authenticating AI Agent' page, which requires the use of the `authenticate_with_auth_agent` tool as per the instructions. The next immediate goal is to authenticate the agent.

INFO     [Agent] 📍 Step 3:
INFO     [Agent]   🧠 Memory: The previous attempt to use `authenticate_with_auth_agent` failed because the agent could not extract the `request_id`. This is usually a transient issue or a problem with the page loading fully. Since I am on the correct page ('Authenticating AI Agent' with a spinner), I must retry the `authenticate_with_auth_agent` tool. The ultimate goal is to complete authentication and reach the dashboard.

INFO     [Agent]   🧠 Memory: The previous two attempts to use `authenticate_with_auth_agent` failed with an internal error message, despite being on the correct 'Authenticating AI Agent' page. This suggests a transient issue with the tool's execution or the page state. Since the goal is to authenticate, I must retry the `authenticate_with_auth_agent` tool. I will try again, and if it fails, I might need to wait or navigate back and try the whole process again, but for now, the immediate goal is to successfully authenticate.
