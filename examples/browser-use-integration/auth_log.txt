When the spinning authentication page appears (shows 'Authenticating AI Agent' with a spinner), use the authenticate_with_auth_agent tool to complete the authentication. Wait for the page to redirect after authentication succeeds. Keep waiting until you reach the dashboard page - do not stop until you see the dashboard. The dashboard should show profile information or user/agent data. Only use the 'done' tool when you have successfully reached and verified you are on the dashboard page.[0m
